\section{Introduction}
High quality seismic images are crucial for understanding underground geological structures. They facilitate qualitative and quantitative interpretation and enable further analysis such as automated feature recognition.

Owing to the complex nature of the Earth's subsurface and the seismic image construction process noise inevitably contaminates the data and can significantly affect its quality. This noise can be caused by many factors during both the reflection data acquisition process, for example from environmental noise, as well as during processing, such as migration. 

Various factors contribute to seismic noise, but they can be classified into two broad types: coherent noise and random noise. Coherent noise is signal dependent that shows consistent phase from trace to trace, examples are include ground roll and multiples. Random noise that is uncorrelated from trace to trace often caused by disturbances in the sub-surface environment. Effective noise attenuation removes noise whilst preserving the signals from the seismic data improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).

There are a multitude of traditional methods for attenuating noise that have been used. Some of these methods include; filter-based strategies, such as mean filtering~\cite{Liu20062d} or f-x de-convolution ~\cite{hornbostel1991spatial}; spare transformation-based strategies, such as using Fourier transforms ~\cite{alsdorf1997noise} or wavelet transform ~\cite{Albert2009wavelet}; and modal decomposition techniques, such as empirical mode decomposition ~\cite{bekara2009random} and singular value decomposition ~\cite{bekara2007local}. These methods have differing drawbacks such as they are not adaptive, applying consistently across the data, and they often rely on expert experience for manual parameter selection.

In recent years there has been a vast amount of research and many advances in the application of deep learning to tasks for natural image datasets, including on models to denoise and improve image quality. The drawbacks of traditional methods, combined with these advances and available computational power, have led to the application of deep neural network models for seismic denoising. 

Whilst various application of deep learning frameworks to seismic data have been explored, there has been little in the way of utilising the more current architectures, and their trained models, proven effective on natural images. Given the ability for modern deep neural networks to effectively extract multi-scale  features for natural images and produce models that can generalise across domains. The challenge then is to to explore the progress in deep learning frameworks for natural datasets, and their applicability to seismic data. Investigate and evaluating the effectiveness of different transfer learning approaches and training strategies, utilising Geoteric's in-house synthetic data model to produce training data.

Improving the noise removal process is a significant area for research as it enables more accurate imaging and thus improved interpretation of the geological structures. This work seeks to further develop the area of seismic image de-noising using deep learning, and contribute towards the commercial development of denoising/restoration products. High quality seismic data also facilitate down-stream applications such as for identifying appropriate sites Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage.

\subsection{Literature review}
[As noise removal is a highly ill-posed problem. Deep learning networks implicitly learning by capturing natural image statistics from large data sets]
The use of neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have led the advancements in learning models for Image restoration and denoising over recent years. Many state of the art networks for denoising use CNNs as they are able to learn spatial hierarchies of patterns and to learn generalised image priors.

The use of residual blocks in CNNs ~\cite{he2015DeepRL} allowed gradients to flow through the block helping to address the issue of vanishing gradients facilitating the use of much deeper networks. In image restoration tasks where the original mapping is closer to an identity mapping, the residual mapping will be much easier to optimise and can improve performance. Residual blocks were then implemented in the influential denoising convolutional neural network (DcCNN) ~\cite{zhang2017beyond}, which lead to significantly increased denoising performance than traditional Gaussian denoisers.


One of the difficulties in application is lack of real training data for seismic models and reliance on synthetic data.
